CC-621 (mt?) was used to produce gametes. Chlamydomonas cells were grown in Tris-acetate- phosphate (TAP) liquid medium (Harris 1989) on a rotary shaker at 23°C, under constant light. Gametes were generated essen- tially as described (Wegener et al. 1989). Gametic differentiation was induced by transferring vegetative cells in mid-log phase to N-free TAP medium for 18–20 h under the same culture condi- tions.","Total RNA was extracted from Chlamydomonas cultures at vegetative growth in TAP medium using Trizol (Invitrogen), and small RNAs were enriched by PEG precipitation method.
